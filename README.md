### Explanation for `cutie.py`

`cutie.py` defines a class, `CutieScraper`, which is responsible for scraping and extracting information from a website. This class includes various methods for fetching HTML content, searching for individuals, retrieving detailed information, and processing the data. Here's an overview of what each part does:

1. **Initialization and Dictionaries**:
   - The class initializes with dictionaries that contain mappings for various roles and entities.
   - These dictionaries are used to categorize and format data.

2. **HTML Fetching**:
   - `html_info(url)`: Fetches and parses the HTML content of a given URL.
   - Handles HTTP requests and potential errors.

3. **Person Search and Information Retrieval**:
   - `html_person_search(person_name)`: Constructs a search URL using the person's name and retrieves the person's ID from the search results.
   - `html_person_info(person_name)`: Uses the person's ID to fetch detailed HTML information about the person.

4. **Project Information Retrieval**:
   - `html_project_info(project_id)`: Fetches detailed HTML information about a project using its ID.

5. **Data Extraction**:
   - `person_base(soup)`: Extracts basic information about a person from the HTML content.
   - `person_info(person_name)`: Combines search and base extraction methods to get comprehensive information about a person.
   - `get_roles(soup)`: Extracts roles associated with a person or institution from the HTML content.
   - `find_dict(roles)`: Categorizes and formats roles into predefined categories.
   - `project_info(project_id)`: Extracts detailed information about a project, including associated roles.

6. **Combining Information**:
   - `combined_info(person_name)`: Combines information about a person and their associated projects into a comprehensive data structure.

### Explanation for `cutie_main.py`

`cutie_main.py` is the main script that orchestrates the scraping process using the `CutieScraper` class. It includes the following steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Imports necessary dependencies and initializes the `CutieScraper` class.

2. **Defining People to Scrape**:
   - A list of names is defined for which information will be scraped.

3. **Processing**:
   - Iterates through each name in the list and uses the `combined_info` method of `CutieScraper` to retrieve and combine data.
   - Handles any errors that occur during the process.

4. **Storing Results**:
   - The results are stored in a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.
   - The combined data is saved to a JSON file for persistent storage.

5. **Output**:
   - Prints the DataFrame to the console.
   - Confirms that the data has been saved to a JSON file.

By integrating `cutie.py` and `cutie_main.py`, the project provides a structured and automated way to scrape, process, and store information from the specified website, focusing on extracting relevant data about people and their associated projects.
